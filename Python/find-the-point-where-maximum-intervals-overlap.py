Consider a big party where a log register for guestâ€™s entry and exit times is maintained. 
Find the time at which there are maximum guests in the party. Note that entries in register are not in any order.

Input: arrl[] = {1, 2, 9, 5, 5}
       exit[] = {4, 5, 12, 9, 12}
First guest in array arrives at 1 and leaves at 4, 
second guest arrives at 2 and leaves at 5, and so on.

Output: 5
There are maximum 3 guests at time 5.

    An Efficient Solution is to use sorting n O(nLogn) time. The idea is to consider all events (all arrivals and exits) 
    in sorted order. Once we have all events in sorted order, we can trace the number of guests at any time keeping track of guests that have arrived, but not exited.
