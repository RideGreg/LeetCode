# Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.
# An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally
# or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
#
# Example 1:
#
# 11110
# 11010
# 11000
# 00000
# Answer: 1
#
# Example 2:
#
# 11000
# 11000
# 00100
# 00011
# Answer: 3
