# Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
#
# A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
#
# For example,
# X X X X
# X O O X
# X X O X
# X O X X
# After running your function, the board should be:
#
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X X X X
# X O X X
#

# Solution: There are 2 types of 'X': surrounded and connected-to-boarder. It is difficult to
# find surrounded 'X' by DFS/BFS because it can only be determined later if the 'X' connects to
# boarder. A good way is to start with four sides and find all 'X' connecting to boarder, mark
# them using another letter, then all remaining 'X' is surrounded 'X'.
