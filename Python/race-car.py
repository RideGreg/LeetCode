# Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line.
# (Your car can go into negative positions.)
#
# Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of
# instructions A (accelerate) and R (reverse).
#
# When you get an instruction "A", your car does the following:
# position += speed, speed *= 2.
#
# When you get an instruction "R", your car does the following:
# if your speed is positive then speed = -1 , otherwise speed = 1.
# (Your position stays the same.)
#
# For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to
# positions 0->1->3->3, and your speed goes to 1->2->4->-1.
#
# Now for some target position, say the length of the shortest
# sequence of instructions to get there.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:
# target = 3
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".
# Your position goes from 0->1->3.
# Example 2:
# Input:
# target = 6
# Output: 5
# Explanation:
# The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".
# Your position goes from 0->1->3->7->7->6.
#
# Note:
#  1 <= target <= 10000.


# Approach Framework
# Explanation
#
# Let A^k denote the command AAAâ‹¯A (k times). Starting with an "R" command doesn't help, and the optimal sequence
# does not end on an "R". So let's suppose our command is always of the form A^{k_1} R A^{k_2} R ... A^{k_n}.
# Note that under such a command, the car will move to final position (2^{k_1} - 1) - (2^{k_2} - 1) + (2^{k_3} - 1) - ...
#
# A key claim is that k_i is bounded by a+1, where a is the smallest integer such that 2^a >= target.
# Basically, if you drive past the target, you don't need to keep driving. Because that must get erased
# by one or more negative terms later.

    # Algorithm
    # Dijkstra's algorithm uses a priority queue to continually searches the path with the lowest cost
    # to destination, so that when we reach the target, we know it must have been through the lowest cost path.
    #
    # Back to the problem, we have some barrier where we are guaranteed to never cross. We will also handle
    # negative targets; in total we will have 2 * barrier + 1 nodes.
    #
    # After, we could move walk = 2**k - 1 steps for a cost of k + 1 (the 1 is to reverse). If we reach our
    # destination exactly, we don't need the R, so it is just k steps.
